        <p><strong>What is Intention?</strong></p>
        <p>The Intention Algorithm is an innovative cryptographic method, developed over five years, to recover lost Bitcoin private keys without brute force and without compromising decentralization. It introduces a new cryptographic paradigm: recovery through distributed inference based on intention.</p>
        <p>Intention is not just a theory; it's a proven methodology that applies advanced cryptographic techniques, ensuring that a lost private key can be recovered without damaging the Bitcoin network's integrity.</p>

    <section id="roadmap">
        <h4>Roadmap</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1 - Research and Development:</strong> Completed – 5 years of theoretical work and controlled environment testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2 - Test Network Validation:</strong> In progress – Successful tests and private key mapping on the simulated network.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 3 - Pre-Mainnet Tests:</strong> Coming soon – Optimization for the main network and controlled testing using wallets with no value.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 4 - Full Mainnet Deployment:</strong> Pending – Full deployment on the mainnet will occur once all security protocols are completed and the necessary funds are secured.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Investment Opportunities</h4>
        <p>The Intention Project is seeking investors who share our vision of a decentralized key recovery protocol. Your investment will help us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimize the algorithm for mainnet operation.</li>
            <li>Ensure strong security measures and privacy for all users.</li>
            <li>Conduct real-world testing to guarantee full reliability of the recovery process.</li>
            <li>Develop and implement an easy-to-use interface for accessing the recovery system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are currently seeking an investment of $50,000 to complete the final development phase and ensure secure implementation on the Bitcoin mainnet.</p>
