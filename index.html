    <h2>Project Intention</h2>
    <h3>Decentralized Cryptographic Recovery · Smart Protection · A New Frontier</h3>
    
    <h4>What is Project Intention?</h4>
    <p>Project Intention is a cryptographic revolution that breaks everything you thought you knew about security and key loss in Bitcoin. For over five years, our founders, Imalaca and EntropySeeker, have been silently working on an algorithm capable of the impossible: recovering lost private keys without brute force, without violating the network, and without compromising decentralization.</p>
    <p>Intention is the first system in the world that doesn’t search for keys randomly. Instead, it utilizes an approach called Intentional Distributed Inference, which combines mathematical projection maps with advanced probability models. What once seemed unrecoverable, can now be restored with pinpoint precision.</p>
    
    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
    <p>While other methods rely on luck or computational power, Intention identifies natural patterns of intention in the creation of keys, using advanced mathematics to reduce a universe of possibilities to a high-probability focal point. When a user requests assistance, Intention does not explore randomly: it reconstructs the mental and mathematical map that led to the original creation of their private key, cross-referencing this data with a distributed model that operates in secure environments.</p>
    
    <h4>"Vuelta" Module: Protection Against Theft</h4>
    <p>What if someone steals your funds? Enter our “Vuelta” system.</p>
    <p>Vuelta is a hidden protocol that can be embedded in any compatible wallet. In the event of unauthorized movement (e.g., if someone accesses your funds without your knowledge), it triggers a scheduled recovery sequence that redirects the funds to a new, secure address belonging to the true owner.</p>
    <p>It’s like an immune system within your wallet: silent, vigilant, and ready to act only when needed.</p>
    
    <h4>Historical Examples: When Technology Made the Impossible Happen</h4>
    <p>Recovering Neanderthal DNA seemed impossible 30 years ago. Today, we study it as if we’re taking a saliva sample.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin itself was ridiculed at first: money without a bank, without a government, without backing. Today it moves economies.</p>
    <p>The Nazi Enigma code seemed unbreakable until Alan Turing and his team changed the course of history.</p>
    <p>Now it’s the turn of Intention. What was once called “irreversible” or “lost forever” in Bitcoin... is no longer the case.</p>

    <h4>Why Participate?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Because you can support one of the boldest technologies since Bitcoin’s birth.</li>
      <li>Because if you ever lose your private key, you’re no longer doomed.</li>
      <li>Because you can invest early in a solution that will have a profound impact on the crypto ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Because you’ll be protecting millions, perhaps billions, of users from catastrophic losses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Investment Opportunity</h4>
    <p>We are raising $50,000 to complete the final development phase and safely conduct mainnet tests. Early sponsors will have priority participation in the recovery license system and the integration of Vuelta into third-party wallets.</p>
