        <h1>Intention Project</h1>
        <h2>A New Era in Cryptographic Key Recovery</h2>
        <p><strong>What is Intention Project?</strong></p>
        <p>Intention Project is a cryptographic revolution that breaks everything you thought you knew about Bitcoin key security and loss. For over five years, our founders, Imalaca and EntropySeeker, have been silently working on an algorithm capable of the impossible: recovering lost private keys without brute force, without violating the network, and without compromising decentralization.</p>
        <p>Intention is the first system in the world that does not search for keys randomly. Instead, it uses an approach called Intentional Distributed Inference, combining mathematical projection maps with advanced probability models. What was once thought to be irrecoverable can now be restored with millimetric precision.</p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>While other methods rely on luck or computational power, Intention identifies natural patterns of intent in key creation, using advanced mathematics to reduce a universe of possibilities to a high-probability focal point. When a user requests help, Intention does not search randomly: it reconstructs the mental and mathematical map that led to the original creation of their private key, cross-referencing this data with a distributed model that operates in secure environments.</p>

        <h4>“Vuelta” Module: Protection Against Theft</h4>
        <p>What if someone steals your funds? This is where our “Vuelta” system comes in.</p>
        <p>Vuelta is a hidden protocol that can be embedded in any compatible wallet. If unauthorized movement is detected (for example, if someone accesses your funds without your knowledge), a recovery sequence is triggered that sends the funds to a new secure address of the rightful owner.</p>
        <p>It’s like an immune system inside your wallet: silent, watchful, and ready to act only when needed.</p>

    <!-- Historical Examples -->
    <section id="examples">
        <h4>Historical Examples: When Technology Achieved the Impossible</h4>
        <p>Recovering Neanderthal DNA seemed impossible 30 years ago. Today, we study it as if it were a saliva sample.</p>
        <p>Bitcoin itself was a ridiculed idea at first: money without a bank, without a government, without backing. Today, it moves economies.</p>
        <p>The Nazi Enigma code seemed unbreakable until Alan Turing and his team changed the course of history.</p>
        <p>Now it’s Intention’s turn. What was once called “irreversible” or “lost forever” in Bitcoin... is no longer the case.</p>

    <!-- Why Participate -->
    <section id="investment">
        <h4>Why Participate?</h4>
        <p>Because you can support one of the boldest technologies since the birth of Bitcoin.</p>
        <p>Because if you ever lose your private key, you are no longer condemned.</p>
        <p>Because you can invest early in a solution that will have a profound impact on the crypto ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Because you will be protecting millions of users from catastrophic losses.</p>

    <!-- Roadmap -->
    <section id="roadmap">
        <h4>Roadmap</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1 - Research and Development:</strong> Completed – 5 years of theoretical work and controlled environment testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2 - Test Network Validation:</strong> In progress – Successful tests and private key mapping on the simulated network.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 3 - Pre-Mainnet Tests:</strong> Coming soon – Optimization for the main network and controlled testing using wallets with no value.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 4 - Full Mainnet Deployment:</strong> Pending – Full deployment on the mainnet will occur once all security protocols are completed and the necessary funds are secured.</li>
        </ul>
